*   **_Cabinet_ 47: Logistics (Fall 2012).**
	"Every time you put a letter in the mail, every time you stop at a traffic light, a complex--and usually invisible--network of logistics is at work. This issue also features James Whittington on the diaries of Dmitri Pavlov; Jacqueline Bochner on the harmonization of international postal systems; Daniella Stone on the logistics of the hospital kitchen; and a travelogue from the Cabinet 'Hand-Delivered Issue Road Trip.' Elsewhere in the issue: Rasha Salti on intrigue and celebrity in the bar of Beirut’s Phoenicia Hotel; Jeffrey Kastner on saintly 'incorruptibles'; and Will Wiles on Bill Phillips’ “MONIAC,” a device that models the national economy using the flow of liquids."

Mining and Extraction
=====================
*   **June Nash, _We Eat the Mines and the Mines Eat Us: Dependency and Exploitation in Bolivian Tin Mines_ (New York: Columbia University Press, 1979).**
	"This book is about the high human cost of producing tin and other minerals. June Nash vividly describes the arduous physical labor and life of Bolivian miners in the physically inhospitable Andean mountains. More than an anthropological account of indigenous miners in far-off Bolivia, the book is a serious rendering of the contemporary social, economic, and political reality at the industrial world periphery."
*   **Andrew Walsh, "'Hot money' and daring consumption in a northern Malagasy sapphire-mining town," _American Ethnologist_ 30 (2003): 290–305.**
	"In Ambondromifehy, a sapphire-mining town in northern Madagascar, young men earn and spend a great deal of what some call 'hot money.' Rather than invest their earnings with long-term intentions considered responsible and proper by some around them, they consume 'daringly' by spending money to fulfill immediate desires. Walsh argues that such 'daring consumption' might be understood as the active response of young men who refuse the passive roles allotted them by both the sapphire trade and traditional systems of social organization."

Production and Assembly
=======================
*   **Leslie Chang, _Factory Girls: From Village to City in a Changing China_ (New York: Spiegel & Grau, 2009).**
	"China has 130 million migrant workers—the largest number in history. Factory Girls tells the story of two young women. From the assembly lines of Dongguan, an industrial city in China’s Pearl River Delta, Chang paints a picture of a world where everyone is under thirty; where you can lose your boyfriend when you lose your mobile phone; where English lessons can catapult you into a different social class. She takes us inside a sneaker factory so large that it has its own hospital; karaoke bars that are fronts for prostitution; all before coming back to a farming village for the Chinese New Year, revealing the poverty and idleness of rural life.""
*   **Aihwa Ong, _Spirits of Resistance and Capitalist Discipline: Factory Women in Malaysia_ (Albany: Suny Press, 1987).**
	"Why are Malay women workers periodically seized by spirit possession on the shopfloors of modern factories? Ong captures the disruptions, conflicts, and ambivalences as they make the transition from peasant society to industrial production. To discover the meaning that the market economy and wage labor holds, Ong conducted anthropological field work in an agricultural district in Selangor, Peninsular Malaysia, undergoing rapid proletarianization. Weaving together history, ethnography, and quantitative analysis, she shows how the diverging roles of young men and women are increasingly channelled toward conformity with corporate culture and capitalist discipline."

Shipping and Distribution
=========================
*   **Deborah Cowen, _The Deadly Life of Logistics: Mapping Violence in Global Trade_ (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2014).**
	"In The Deadly Life of Logistics, Cowen traces the art and science of logistics from the battlefield to the boardroom and back. Focusing on choke points such as national borders, zones of piracy, blockades, and cities, she tracks contemporary efforts to keep goods circulating and brings to light the collective violence these efforts produce. All the while investigating how the military origins of logistics played a critical role in the making of the global economic order-—not simply the globalization of production, but the invention of the supply chain and the reorganization of national economies into transnational systems."
*   **Edna Bonacich, Jake B. Wilson, _Getting the Goods: Ports, Labor, and the Logistics Revolution_ (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2008).**
	"Edna Bonacich and Jake B. Wilson look at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to examine the impact of the logistics on workers in distribution. Built around the invention of shipping containers and communications technology, the logistics 'revolution' has enabled retailers like Walmart and Target to sell cheap consumer products made using low-wage labor in developing countries. Shipped through an efficient, low-cost, intermodal freight system, containers move from factories in Asia to distribution centers across the United States without ever being opened. Bonacich and Wilson follow these flows, exploring the importers, container shipping companies, the ports, railroad and trucking companies, and warehouses."

Critical Perspectives
=====================
*   **"Logistics of Power" in _Viewpoint Magazine_, no. 4: "The State," particularly: Alberto Toscano, "[Lineaments of the Logistical State](https://viewpointmag.com/2014/09/28/lineaments-of-the-logistical-state/)"; Deborah Cowen, "[Disrupting Distribution: Subversion, the Social Factory, and the 'State' of Supply Chains](https://viewpointmag.com/2014/10/29/disrupting-distribution-subversion-the-social-factory-and-the-state-of-supply-chains/)"; and Sergio Bologna, "[Inside Logistics: Organization, Work, Distinctions](https://viewpointmag.com/2014/10/29/inside-logistics-organization-work-distinctions/)" (September-October 2014).**
	As Toscano remarks, "it has long been noted that the apparatuses of control and accumulation that structure the social and material reality of circulation – transport, the energy industry and, after World War Two, “business logistics” – though born to break the bargaining power of transport workers and accumulate profits by annihilating space and depressing wages, have also, especially through their energetic dimensions, created dynamic arenas for class struggle.
*   **Fredric Jameson, "Utopia as Replication" in _Valences of the Dialectic_ (New York: Verso, 2009).**
	"This is the point at which I wish to propose a model for Utopian analysis that might be taken as a kind of synthesis of these two subjective and objective approaches. I want to develop two examples of this kind of interpretation, which will be what I want to identify, not as the Utopian method as such, but at least as one possible method among others: and these examples will draw on history and theory respectively. My theoretical example will be drawn from the now burgeoning field of manifestos for a politics of the “multitude”; my historical example will however propose a new institutional candidate for the function of Utopian allegory and that is the phenomenon called Wal-Mart."

History and Historiography
==========================
*   **Sven Beckert, _Empire of Cotton: A Global History_ (New York: Knopf, 2014).**
	"Cotton is so ubiquitous as to be almost invisible, yet understanding its history is key to understanding the origins of modern capitalism. Sven Beckert tells the story of how, in a remarkably brief period, European entrepreneurs and powerful statesmen recast the world’s most significant manufacturing industry, combining imperial expansion and slave labor with new machines and wage workers to change the world. The empire of cotton was, from the beginning, a fulcrum of constant global struggle between slaves and planters, merchants and statesmen, workers and factory owners. Beckert makes clear how these forces ushered in the world of modern capitalism, and how the present global world came to exist."
*   **Sidney Mintz, _Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar and Modernity_ (New York: Viking, 1985).**
	"Studying a single food or commodity such as sugar may seem like an incongruous project for an anthropologist who claims to work mostly with living people. Still, it is a rich subject for someone interested in the history and character of the modern world, for its importance and popularity rose together with tea, colonial slavery, and the machine era. Had it not been for the immense importance of sugar in the world history of food, and in the daily lives of so many, I would have left it alone ... My work on sugar, _Sweetness and Power_, situates it within Western history because it was an old commodity, basic to the emergence of a global market."

*   **Pietra Rivoli and Sandra Waddock, “‘First They Ignore You…’: The Time-Context Dynamic and Corporate Responsibility,” _California Management Review_ 53, no. 2 (Winter 2011): 87-104.**
	"Pietra Rivoli and Sandra Waddock acknowledge that corporate social responsibility (CSR) discussions often fall prey to a logical trap. If some socially desirable activity is profitable, then it is best described as “intelligent operation of the business.” When private profits and public welfare are aligned, CSR is irrelevant. If the socially desirable activity is not profitable, then companies will not voluntarily undertake it unless required to do so by law or regulation. The concept of CSR is “intensely confused” because in both the above cases it is not a useful construct; CSR is either irrelevant or ineffective."
*   **Anne Mayhew, _Narrating the Rise of Big Business in the USA: How Economists Explain Standard Oil and Wal-Mart_ (New York: Routledge, 2008).**
	"'This is a story about stories and specifically about some of the stories that Americans have told themselves about corporate economic power.' In this book, Anne Mayhew focuses on the stories surrounding the creation of Standard Oil and Wal-Mart and their founders , John D. Rockefeller and Sam Walton, combining the accounts of economists with the somewhat darker pictures painted by writers of fiction to tease out the overarching narratives associated with American big business."

New Materialisms and Theories of Things
=======================================
*   **Arjun Appadurai, _The Social Life of Things_ (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986).**
	"The meaning that people attribute to things necessarily derives from human transactions and motivations, particularly from how those things are used and circulated. The contributors to this volume examine how things are sold and traded in a variety of social and cultural settings, both present and past. Focusing on culturally defined aspects of exchange and socially regulated processes of circulation, the essays illuminate the ways in which people find value in things and things give value to social relations. By looking at things as if they lead social lives, the authors provide a new way to understand how value is externalized and sought after."
*   **Bill Brown, _Things_ (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 2004).**
	"This book is an invitation to think about why children chew pencils; why we talk to our cars and computers; rosary beads and worry beads; the fetishism of daily life in different times and in different cultures. It is an invitation to rethink several topics of critical inquiry—camp, collage, primitivism, consumer culture, museum culture, the aesthetic object, still life, "things as they are," Renaissance wonders, "the thing itself"—within the rubric of "things," not in an effort to foreclose the question of what sort of things these seem to be, but rather to suggest new questions about how objects produce subjects, about the phenomenology of the material everyday, about the secret life of things."

It is interested in how logistical infrastructure is made soft through ERP systems designed to govern the global movement of people, finance and things. Questions of securitization, control, coordination, algorithmic architectures, protocols and parameters are among those relevant to a theory of logistical media--bringing logistics, software and infrastructure together in order to elaborate the conceptual and empirical qualities of what John Durham Peters elusively terms 'logistical media.'"

Congress enacted Section 1502 of the Act because of concerns that the exploitation and trade of conflict minerals by armed groups is helping to finance conflict in the DRC region and is contributing to an emergency humanitarian crisis."

Logistical Films
================
*   **Allan Sekula, _[The Forgotten Space](http://www.theforgottenspace.net/static/home.html)_ (2010); 112 minutes.**
	"The Forgotten Space follows container cargo aboard ships, barges, trains and trucks, listening to workers, engineers, planners, politicians, and those marginalized by the global transport system. We visit displaced farmers and villagers in Holland and Belgium, underpaid truck drivers in Los Angeles, seafarers aboard mega-ships shuttling between Asia and Europe, and factory workers in China, whose low wages are the fragile key to the whole puzzle. And in Bilbao, we discover the most sophisticated expression of the belief that the maritime economy, and the sea itself, is somehow obsolete."
*   **Lucy Raven, _[China Town](http://lucyraven.com/China-Town)_ (2009); 51 minutes.**
	"China Town traces copper mining and production from an open pit mine in Nevada to a smelter in China, where the semi-processed ore is sent to be smelted and refined. Considering what it actually means to “be wired” and in turn, to be connected, in today’s global economic system, the video follows the detailed production process that transforms raw ore into copper wire—in this case, the literal digging of a hole to China—and the generation of waste and of power that grows in both countries as byproduct."
*   **Steve McQueen, _[Gravesend](http://www.renaissancesociety.org/exhibitions/455/steve-mcqueen-gravesend/)_ (2007); 17 minutes.**
	"The film Gravesend uses a documentary approach to focus on the mining of coltan, employed in the manufacture of cell phones, laptops and other high-tech apparatus. The film cuts between two sites: a technological, highly automated industrial plant in the West where the precious metal is processed for the final production of microelectronic parts, and the central Congo, where miners use simple shovels or their bare hands to extract, wash and collect the ore on leaves. In the Congo, the dirt and clumps of ore are barely distinguishable, while in the industrialized West, the metal is weighed in minute milligrams and cast in antiseptic surroundings."
*   **Natasha Raheja, _[Cast in India](https://castinindia.com/)_ (2014); 26 minutes, Bengali and Hindi with English subtitles.**
	"Iconic and ubiquitous, thousands of manhole covers dot the streets of New York City. Enlivening the everyday objects around us, this short documentary is a glimpse of the working lives of the men behind the manhole covers in New York City."
*   **Michael Cot _Shipbreakers_ (2004); 73 minutes.** // [via](https://twitter.com/histoftech)
	"Shipbreakers takes the viewer into the heart of Alang, India, a vibrant shantytown where 40,000 people live and work in the most primitive conditions. Since the early '80s, the rusting hulks of thousands of the world's largest ships have been driven onto the remote beaches of Alang, off the Arabian Sea, to be dismantled, piece by piece. Sold for scrap, the ship owners rarely bother to abide by the UN Basel Convention, which bans shipments of transboundary waste. One worker a day, on average, dies on the job, some from explosions or falls, but many will contract cancers caused by asbestos, PCBs and other toxic substances."
*   **Jennifer Baichwal, _Manufactured Landscapes_ (2006); 90 minutes.**
	"This documentary reveals the gritty underside of industrial landscapes. Photographer Edward Burtynsky explores the subtle beauty amid the waste generated by slag heaps, dumps and factories. Memorable scenes include a Chinese iron factory where employees are berated to produce faster, and shots of children playing atop piles of dangerous debris. The contrasts between wealth and poverty are most striking in Shanghai, with new high-rises towering above old slums."
*   **David Redmon, _Mardi Gras: Made in China_ (2005); 74 minutes.**
	"The life cycle of plastic beads is traced from their manufacture at a Fuzhou, China, manufacturing facility to their extensive use by revelers at the annual Mardi Gras celebration in New Orleans. Documentary filmmaker David Redmon investigates the low wages and substandard conditions endured by the factory's workers, many of whom are young women. Candid interviews with both the Chinese workers and the Mardi Gras crowd reveal the vast economic and cultural chasm between the two."

	"Upon learning that most of Europe’s beet sugar today is consumed outside its borders, the artists devised a plan that began with purchase of that same sugar at a fraction of its domestic price. From there, they set out for Nigeria, a nation which, despite a climate wholly conducive to sugarcane cultivation, was said to be the largest importer of European sugar. Van Brummelen and de Haan’s idea was to transform that raw material into art and reimport it for an exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum."

	"How to study China-led globalisation through infrastructural interventions? This question prompts the investigation of logistical operations that fabricate the emerging trade network known as the New Silk Road. Moving between software studies and geocultural analysis of labour regimes, the project tracks algorithmic arrangements of power across the tricontinental sites of Piraeus, Valparaíso and Kolkata... Subjectivity and labour expose the power and vulnerability of logistical worlds."
*   **[Center for Land Use Interpretation](http://clui.org/)**
	"The Center for Land Use Interpretation is a research and education organization interested in understanding the nature and extent of human interaction with the surface of the earth, and in finding new meanings in the intentional and incidental forms that we individually and collectively create. We believe that the manmade landscape is a cultural inscription, that can be read to better understand who we are, and what we are doing."
*   **[Transit-labour](http://transitlabour.asia/home/)** (X)
	"Transit-labour investigates changing patterns of labour and mobility in the whirlwind of Asian capitalist transformation. Mindful of the view of Asia as the world's factory, this three year research project examines the role of creativity, invention and knowledge production in the new economic order being forged from the region's capitalist centres. Particular attention is given to changing relations of culture and economy in this transition and their entanglement with the production of new subjectivities and modalities of labour."
*   **[followthethings.com](http://www.followthethings.com/)**
	"followthethings.com is a website designed to have the look, feel and navigation of a familiar online store. But it’s stocked with research examining films, art, activist and other work that encourages shoppers to critically consider their relationships with those who make the things that they buy. Its purpose is to encourage careful thought and lively conversation about trade (in)justice, and to encourage and inform new work in this genre of commodity activism."
*   **[The Story of Stuff Project](http://storyofstuff.org/)**
	"We have a problem with Stuff. We use too much, too much of it is toxic and we don’t share it very well. But that’s not the way things have to be. Together, we can build a society based on better not more, sharing not selfishness, community not division."
*   **[Unknown Fields Division](http://www.unknownfieldsdivision.com/)**
	"The Unknown Fields Division is a nomadic design research studio that ventures out on expeditions to the ends of the earth to bear witness to alternative worlds, alien landscapes, industrial ecologies and precarious wilderness. These distant landscapes - the iconic and the ignored, the excavated, irradiated and the pristine, are embedded in global systems that connect them in surprising and complicated ways to our everyday lives. In such a landscape of interwoven narratives, the studio uses film and animation to chronicle this network of hidden stories and re-imagine the complex and contradictory realities of the present as a site of strange and extraordinary futures."
*   **[The Infrastructure Observatory](http://infraobservatory.com/)**
	"The Infrastructure Observatory is a community devoted to exploring and celebrating the infrastructural landscape. Our mission is to render visible the oft-invisible guts of modern life, and foster chapters of enthusiasts around these structures throughout the world. IO is mostly involved in organizing field trips to infrastructure sites"
*   **[Warehouse Workers for Justice](http://www.warehouseworker.org/)**
	"Warehouse Workers for Justice is a worker center founded in 2009 to win stable, living wage jobs with dignity for the hundreds of thousands of workers in Illinois' logistics and distribution industry. We provide workshops so warehouse workers can educate themselves about workplace rights, unite warehouse workers to defend their rights on the job, build community support for the struggles of warehouse workers and fight for policy changes to improve the lives of warehouse workers and members of our communities."

Broader Advocacy
=========================
*   **[Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/)**
	"Many of the world’s worst environmental and human rights abuses are driven by the exploitation of natural resources and corruption in the global political and economic system. Global Witness is campaigning to end this by carrying out hard-hitting investigations, exposing these abuses, and campaigning for change. They are independent, not-for-profit, and work with partners around the world in the fight for justice."
*   **[The Enough Project](http://www.enoughproject.org/)**
	"The Enough Project seeks to build leverage for peace and justice in Africa by helping to create real consequences for the perpetrators and facilitators of genocide and other mass atrocities. Enough aims to counter rights-abusing armed groups and violent kleptocratic regimes that are fueled by grand corruption, transnational crime and terror, and the pillaging and trafficking of minerals, ivory, diamonds, and other natural resources. Enough conducts field research in conflict zones, develops and advocates for policy recommendations, supports social movements in affected countries, and mobilizes public campaigns."
