Project Ideas
=============
These broad outlines are intended to motivate the range of possible projects we might consider as forms of logistical intervention. They should not be taken as an exhaustive or representative listing. 

*   **Reverse Sourcing Field-guide**
    Reverse sourcing is the practice of attempting to locate the sources of assembly for the parts and subcomponents of more complex consumer devices. How can this process be facilitated? Can we imagine tools that make product autopsies automatic, or guide different sort of consumer audiences through the aggregate data necessary to locate the constituent materials or their products and evaluate their impacts?
	
*   **Tracking Numbers**
    Intervene in the ubiquitous tracking number for services like DHL, Fedex, and UPS. Potential ideas might include alternative means of cataloguing these numbers (and the geographies they generate), applying their logics to alternative arenas, or embedding them more materially in the construction of physical and digital objects.
	
*   **Expat Products**
	Contemporary production are expatriated from their countries of origin to live out their lives. If they return, it is only in their final days. What links do they hold to their homelands, what messages might they continue to send? This can range from a simple sense of [awareness](https://github.com/tonsky/AnyBar) to more elaborate constructions.
	
*   **Supply Sensors**
	Signs and sensors to accompany parcels and packages have a surprisingly mundane origin. The most familiar of these, the “fragile” label seemingly spiraled out of customs in maritime shipments of colonial investments and curiosities (from chinaware to the exotic shells praised by naturalists). It arrived in domestic postal regulations more recently, when the bustling nineteenth century interests in invention made the movement of glass a local object of concern. Today the promissory hope of the label finds mechanical assurance in devices like the [Tiltwatch](http://www.shockwatch.com.au/shipping_and_handling_monitors/tilt_indicators/tiltwatch.htm). What other sensors could we imagine? Cameras and GPS enabled devices that live in cargo containers, attach to packages, and peer out at workers on docks and processing facilities?
	
*   **Digital Supply Chains**
	What value is there in considering software productions as logistical objects, and how might we go about uncovering the movements of the bits and bytes that deliver them?
	
*   **Citizen Monitoring**
	Contemporary logistics makes its home in places increasingly restricted to public access and accountability: from special trade zones, to ports, factories, and mines. How can we monitor the activities of these closed geographies, or of the individuals who move within them?
	
*   **Über Uber**
	It is interesting the consider that the companies that stand at the forefront of the most recent wave of high profile startups (companies like Uber, AirBNB, etc.) are primarily founded on their intervention in established logistical paradigms of transportation and geographic networks. In what ways can we imagine their continuation, configuration, or collapse?
	
*   **Punch Clock Narratives**
	The image of the punch clock is the image of the history of the factory. While global capitalism has shaped work into increasingly more abstractly structured regimes, the idea of assembly latent within this image calls together questions of the assembly of individual laborers behind the assembly of material products. Can we imagine new techniques for telling their stories, building new narratives of production both within the factory and without it?
	
*   **Bills and Materials**
	Contemporary logistics rests on the development of a particular paradigm of paperwork developed over the last millennium. Documents like the bill of lading and bill of materials are foundational forms for practices of shipping and production respectively. How can we intervene in these forms, translate them more completely to digital practice, unmake the complicated ties they have forged? What patterns emerge with alternative implementations? 
	
*   **Libraries for Logistics**
	Develop a tool or technology to facilitate a digital humanities style approach to the history of trade and logistics, ideally with a dataset in mind (either one that already exists, or one which your tool will help facilitate the construction of) considering examples such as [Trading Consequences](http://tcqdev.edina.ac.uk/search/commodity/), [Commodity Histories](http://www.commodityhistories.org/).
	
*   **Abstract Impacts**
	In addition to imagining software (particularly networked software) productions as, well, productions, we can also consider them in line with the real world impacts of the systems which produce them. This can involve the energy costs of the systems running them, the political and privacy implications of the countries that host their components, and more. It can also run to the more [fanciful mappings](http://www.greenhackathon.com/2011/hacking-carbon-emissions-into-minecraft/) between the digital and physical.
	
*   **Feral Trade Networks**
	Taking inspiration from Kate Rich’s long running [Feral Trade project](http://www.feraltrade.org/), design and prototype an alternative logistics network that takes the place of, or overlaps with, established commercial distribution networks. This inevitably suggests targeting local markets, specialized suppliers, and other “small scale” productions (examples here include projects like the [Urban Fruit Initiative](http://www.greenhackathon.com/2014/urban-fruit-initiative/))— but think big. Alternative logistics networks can involve unique ways of managing existing relationships and supply networks or new networks themselves.
	
*   **Impacted Interactions**
	The measure of an [impact](http://london.greenhackathon.com/hacks/amee-in-excel/) is only as valuable as the context one encounters it in. How can we incorporate impact measures into representations of design and logistical practice?
	
*   **Commodity Coding**
	Everywhere and always discussions that reference commodities now possess a precision that was never before possible. Analyze how writing on the web makes use of the links to commodity outlines that serve as markers of identity, and universal references for the materials that comprise that identity. Intervene through the production of bots and parsers that augment these capabilities—or which undermine them.
	
*   **Tagging in the Wild**
	Consider how [tags](https://www.thetileapp.com/) could change or evolve over time as they become personal artifacts. What narratives do they create and collect, and how can we help to represent those in meaningful ways?
	
*   **Logistics Games**
	Design and prototype a simple logistics game. While the idea of this sort of game often evokes simulations of urban planning, transportation networks, and supply and distribution schemes, “logistics” can be considered broadly to include any kind of simulation that attempts to model efficient interactions within non-trivial world systems—or the kinds of interactions and actors that surround them. By this definition, for example, games like Sim City, Mini Metro, and OpenTTD might be included, but participants might find inspiration in the bureaucratic modeling of Papers Please, or the small scale decision making of Gods Will Be Watching.
