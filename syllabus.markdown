_Indo Arya’s Warehouse at Hassangarh, Haryana. At the time of its opening in 2012, India’s largest distribution center._

The calamitous reach of the global commodity chain stands as a monument to modernity’s practice of production. As contemporary critiques consider its mounting intractability, they reveal the worldwide pattern of logistical machinery given by the media forms and historic technologies that govern its flow. In their conceptual simplicity and historical transigence lies an opportunity for transformation, for innovation, and for interruption. While the vocabulary it draws on might seem familiar, the language of logistics is not fixed. It must be made–and so can be re-made–by the tools and techniques assembled every day in service to supply.

This document, intended for [collaborative iteration](https://github.com/hock/SupplyStudiesSyllabus), presents a series of readings in areas of interest to the critical study of logistics. It begins with an opening "[Stage Setting](#stagesetting)" section and continues on to topics in: [Logistical Media](#logisticalmedia); [Mining and Extraction](#miningandextraction); [Production and Assembly](#productionandassembly); [Shipping, Storage, Distribution](#shippingstoragedistribution); [Speculations on Supply](#speculationsonsupply); [Activism and Resistance](#activismandresistance); [Logistical Histories](#logisticalhistories); [Commodity Communications](#commoditycommunications); [Migration, Mobility, and Movement](#migrationmobilityandmovement); [Corporations and Capitalism](#corporationsandcapitalism); [Computational Production](#computationalproduction); [Infrastructures and Spaces](#infrastructuresandspaces); and [Consumers and Consumption](#consumersandconsumption). The goal is to present a broad selection of texts from which more specialized seminars can be developed, or which could be incorporated into other courses. 

It also serves as a more general introduction to the field. To this end, it contains supplemental [Reference Materials](#referencematerials), including [Logistics Textbooks](#logisticstextbooks) and a sample of [Logistical Regulations](#logisticalregulations), reports, and legislation, as well as a section on [Logistics in Media](#logisticsinmedia), including documentaries, cinema, games, literature, and art. It also presents an overview of the [Critical Logistics Community](#criticallogisticscommunity) detailing [Special Issues on Logistics](#specialissuesonlogistics), [Syllabi and Conferences](#syllabiandconferences), [Projects and Groups](#projectsandgroups), [Broader Advocacy organizations](#broaderadvocacyorganizations), and a section on [Logistical Praxis](#logisticalpraxis), which collates tools for activities like [Reverse Sourcing](#reversesourcing). 




<a name="stagesetting">Stage Setting</a>
=============
These readings are intended as a broad introduction to supply studies and the critical study of logistics. Working from a mixture of popular and academic articles, these pieces either summarize broad arguments in the field or offer points of discussion for an initial class session centered on the contemporary discourse around logistics.

	`"This focus on supply chains — or supply studies, as some have called it — is rooted in the knowledge that our relationship to technology cannot be understood purely in terms of how we make use of it. Instead, the approach is premised on investigating the metals, refineries, factories, shipping containers, and warehouses that not only manufacture and deliver our electronics, but also form the infrastructure that organizes our society. Supply studies attempts to distill and make legible these global networks, whose complexity obfuscates the harm they cause. It provides a crucial lens for understanding the real origins, and the real impacts, of our devices."`

It's the spiritual core of this particular 'sacrifice zone'—an area of ecological and social degradation resulting from unregulated industry and exploitation.

The invisible labor force toils in factories overseas, but also at ports, along rail lines, and in the many warehouses used to process the flows of commodities."`

<a name="logisticalmedia">Logistical Media</a>
================
Logistical media, John Durham Peters writes, are the media of “orientation,” devices of cognitive, social, and political organization and control like clocks, maps, and calendars. Critical for establishing basic coordinates of time and space, they belong to "a neglected category of media that are so fundamental that they rarely come into view." These media "do not necessarily have 'content.'" Peters argues, but rather exist "prior to and form the grid"" in which messages will be sent. This “grid-like functioning" not only gestures to the foundational work of media theorists such as Harold Innis, James Carey, Lewis Mumford, and Paul Virilio, it suggests the ways this definition has been taken up scholars like Peters, Judd Case, and Ned Rossiter.

*	John Durham Peters, "Calendar, Clock, Tower" in _Deus in Machina: Religion, Technology, and the Things in Between_, ed. Jeremy Stolow (New York: Fordham University Press, 2012).
	`"Peters provides a synthetic treatment of the long history of human efforts to measure, divide, and coordinate space and time, demonstrating how evolving technologies for orienting people have served as both partners and competitors with religious institutions, disciplinary practices, and sources of knowledge about the cosmos. From the development of systems of calendrical reckoning for identifying religiously significant dates, and the strategic use of towers for the diverse religious purposes of celestial and terrestrial observation, to the surveillance of populations, and broadcasting of messages, Peters introduces the notion of “logistical media” to refer to the fundamental, pre-discursive mechanisms and techniques used to coordinate communications and activities."`

	`"In this article, we analyze some elements of radar prehistory to emphasize the idea of ​​logistic media. They order and arrange people and objects and subtly influence our experiences of space and time. They focus on logistics, feedback and remote control in communication. They also evoke the work of Harold Innis, Norbert Wiener, James W. Carey, Lewis Mumford and Paul Virilio, as well as the transitive model of communication. This article considers the torpedo, the searchlight, the war horn and the death ray from a logistical point of view, as precursors of the radar. He then proposes the analysis of other logistic media."`
*	Ned Rossiter, _Software, Infrastructure, Labor: A Media Theory of Logistical Nightmares_ (New York: Routledge, 2016).
	`"Infrastructure makes worlds. Software coordinates labor. Logistics governs movement. These pillars of contemporary capitalism correspond with the materiality of digital communication systems on a planetary scale. Ned Rossiter theorizes the force of logistical media to discern how subjectivity and labor, economy and society are tied to the logistical imaginary of seamless interoperability. Contingency haunts logistical power. Technologies of capture are prone to infrastructural breakdown, sabotage, and failure. Strategies of evasion, anonymity, and disruption unsettle regimes of calculation and containment. We live in a computational age where media, again, disappear into the background as infrastructure. Software, Infrastructure, Labor intercuts transdisciplinary theoretical reflection with empirical encounters ranging from the Cold War legacy of cybernetics, shipping ports in China and Greece, the territoriality of data centers, video game design, and scrap metal economies in the e-waste industry. Rossiter argues that infrastructural ruins serve as resources for the collective design of blueprints and prototypes demanded of radical politics today."`

	`"Buffering, namely the need to preload data before streaming a video or audio file, epitomizes the oft-ignored ruptures and disruptions of digital engagement. Whereas buffering is often read as “noise” or as a technical nuisance awaiting a solution, a closer look can challenge our notion of mediation, immersion, and control. By contextualizing the study of buffering within a rich history of spectatorial and sonic noise, this article explores the unique “perpetual anxiety” it invokes and exposes, as well as the tension between pleasure and pain embodied in recognizing the imperfections of a supposedly seamless techno-utopia."`



<a name="miningandextraction">Mining and Extraction</a>
=====================
The logistics of production's upstream end is found in the excavation of "natural" resources and the "raw" materials that lie buried in the earth. But these materials are rarely as pristine as they appear. While media studies has only recently begun to turn to the complex materiality of media technologies, the study of extractive regimes and the sites they occupy has been of longstanding interest to anthropologists and ethnographers, just as the troubled practices that occupy these operations suggest the need for deeper connections to labor history.

Walsh argues that such 'daring consumption' might be understood as the active response of young men who refuse the passive roles allotted them by both the sapphire trade and traditional systems of social organization."`

<a name="productionandassembly">Production and Assembly</a>
=======================
Modern objects are networked objects. An entity like the mobile phone is not only connected, literally, within the telecommunication network. Like all global productions, it is inescapably enmeshed in the material network of its making. It is composed of cadmium, nickel, and lithium, constituted from gold, copper, tantalum, and tin. Buy to this litany of already troublesome elements, a comprehensive account must add actors, sites, and politics—both lives and ways of life. And it must contend with the ideologies of assembly that have brought them together. Consumer interest in distributed production began with outsourcing in the textile industry, but critiques of global assembly encompass everything from the hazards facing garment workers in Bangladesh to the architectures of factory cities in China. 

*   Pun Ngai, _Made in China: Women Factory Workers in a Global Workplace_ (Durham: Duke University Press, 2005).
	`"As China has evolved into an industrial powerhouse over the past two decades, a new class of workers has developed: the dagongmei, or working girls. The dagongmei are women in their late teens and early twenties who move from rural areas to urban centers to work in factories. The young women are not coerced to work in the factories; they know about the twelve-hour shifts and the hardships of industrial labor. Yet they are still eager to leave home. Made in China is a compelling look at the lives of these women, workers caught between the competing demands of global capitalism, the socialist state, and the patriarchal family."`
*   Aihwa Ong, _Spirits of Resistance and Capitalist Discipline: Factory Women in Malaysia_ (Albany: Suny Press, 1987).
	`"Why are Malay women workers periodically seized by spirit possession on the shopfloors of modern factories? Ong captures the disruptions, conflicts, and ambivalences as they make the transition from peasant society to industrial production. To discover the meaning that the market economy and wage labor holds, Ong conducted anthropological field work in an agricultural district in Selangor, Peninsular Malaysia, undergoing rapid proletarianization. Weaving together history, ethnography, and quantitative analysis, she shows how the diverging roles of young men and women are increasingly channelled toward conformity with corporate culture and capitalist discipline."`

Without a serious critique of the sweatshop’s structural reality, any efforts to make fashion more ethical can only be what prison abolitionists call “reformist reforms.” Reformist reforms pursue gentler and more inclusive forms of labor and resource extraction rather than the abolition of this extractive industry altogether."`

<a name="shippingstoragedistribution">Shipping, Storage, Distribution</a>
===============================
The most emblematic images of logistics are of storage and distribution. These are the massive warehouses stacked high with boxes, the colossal container ships that ferry them the world over, the "tens of thousands of human workers" laboring amid a gigantic system "of steel and silicon." And for good reason. The container conjures a "smooth, lossless," "almost immaterial" image of transportation, so much so that, Alexander Klose writes, it is "easily forgotten" that it was "a change in the fundamental order of thinking." For Deborah Cowen, an object like the container is thus a symbol of "logistics space," a cartography defined by the global networks of circulation. For Klose, it is a "time capsule." "Enclosed and sealed in the container," he writes, cargo is removed from the continuum in which it is produced, emerging sometime in the future. 

*   Deborah Cowen, _The Deadly Life of Logistics: Mapping Violence in Global Trade_ (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2014).
	`"In The Deadly Life of Logistics, Cowen traces the art and science of logistics from the battlefield to the boardroom and back. Focusing on choke points such as national borders, zones of piracy, blockades, and cities, she tracks contemporary efforts to keep goods circulating and brings to light the collective violence these efforts produce. All the while investigating how the military origins of logistics played a critical role in the making of the global economic order-—not simply the globalization of production, but the invention of the supply chain and the reorganization of national economies into transnational systems."`

Built around the invention of shipping containers and communications technology, the logistics 'revolution' has enabled retailers like Walmart and Target to sell cheap consumer products made using low-wage labor in developing countries. Shipped through an efficient, low-cost, intermodal freight system, containers move from factories in Asia to distribution centers across the United States without ever being opened. Bonacich and Wilson follow these flows, exploring the importers, container shipping companies, the ports, railroad and trucking companies, and warehouses."`

The winner, who received a two-week vacation to Thailand, came up with a better way of transporting tea lights. They had been packaged loosely in a bag, but a Dutchman had the idea of stacking them in rows and vacuum sealing them. The metal cups encasing the candles were redesigned to sit neatly on top of one another. Ikea then borrowed from another very Nordic industry in constructing a machine that could sort them.

<a name="speculationsonsupply">Speculations on Supply</a>
======================
Supply chains are not new, Anna Tsing reminds us, they extend as far as trade itself. What is new is the "sense of possibility that supply chains offer." Founded on "the enhanced mobility of labor and the economic and political vulnerabilities created by recent forms of imperialism and histories of global war," production was no longer composed of silo-ed sites of assembly. It was a "networked enterprise," tightly coupling suppliers and distributors to maximize the efficiency of the productive process. With associations formed by arrangements of subcontracting, outsourcing, and an overriding logic of flexibility and interchange, "supply chain capitalism" has produced new possibilities for exploitation and defined new subjectivities for those within its web. So too, it demands correspondingly new ways of thinking to unravel them. To that end, this section engages with the critiques and critical theories that engage with the supply chain, logistics, and the global system of circulation.

	`"It has long been noted that the apparatuses of control and accumulation that structure the social and material reality of circulation – transport, the energy industry and, after World War Two, 'business logistics' – though born to break the bargaining power of transport workers and accumulate profits by annihilating space and depressing wages, have also, especially through their energetic dimensions, created dynamic arenas for class struggle."`

	`"We have entered a time of logistics space. Contemporary capitalism is organized as a dispersed but coordinated system, where commodities are manufactured across vast distances, multiple national borders, and complex social and technological infrastructures. Geopolitical economies that were previously governed largely at the national scale – even though as part of a global system of trading nation states – have been reordered into transnational circulatory systems."`

	`"Logistics can never be understood from outside the warehouse, only by coming inside and looking at the techniques employed, the equipment and the organization of work does one understand if we find ourselves faced with something that belongs to the new economy, in the real sense of the term, or that resembles the sweatshops of Bangladesh. There is therefore no organization of standardized labor with specific figures, because every commodity sector has its specificity in industrial logistics, and because in distribution logistics, not all goods are subject to the same treatment (think only of perishable products, the cold chain or dangerous and toxic products). Speaking in the generic sense of “logistics” does not lead us anywhere."`

	`"Since the mid-20th century, logistics has evolved into a wide-ranging science of circulation involved in planning and managing flows of innumerable kinds. In this introductory essay, we take stock of the ascendancy and proliferation of logistics, proposing a critical engagement with the field. We argue that logistics is not limited to the management of supply chains, military or corporate. Rather, it is better understood as a calculative logic and spatial practice of circulation that is at the fore of the reorganization of capitalism and war. Viewed from this perspective, the rise of logistics has transformed not only the physical movement of materials but also the very rationality by which space is organized. It has remade economic and military space according to a universalizing logic of abstract flow, exacerbating existing patterns of uneven geographical development. Drawing on the articles that make up this themed issue, we propose that a critical approach to logistics is characterized by three core commitments: (1) a rejection of the field’s self-depiction as an apolitical science of management, along with a commitment to highlighting the relations of power and acts of violence that underpin it; (2) an interest in exposing the flaws, irrationalities, and vulnerabilities of logistical regimes; and (3) an orientation toward contestation and struggle within logistical networks."`

<a name="activismandresistance">Activism and Resistance</a>
======================= 
As a site of resistance against global capital, the supply chain shares none of the power present in the gatherings once found on the planation or the factory floor. As Charmaine Chua explains, sites like the containerized port have all but been "evacuated of the workers" they once "depended so heavily upon." Supply chain management has shifted capital’s focus from the sites of production to those of circulation, and as a consequence, "the mass labor force expelled from the factory floors of the world has now spilled into the streets, articulating their dissatisfaction with the state of things through uprisings, strikes, blockades, and riots." Has this dispersal, Chua asks, "foreclosed collective action"? If not—if the supply chain may yet be thought of "as a scattered entity" with which one may still engage—then what are its points of vulnerability, the best means of confrontation, and the most effective form of this resistance?

*	Jake Alimahomed-Wilson and Immanuel Ness, eds., _Choke Points: Logistics Workers Disrupting the Global Supply Chain_ (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 2018).
	`"The global economy seems indomitable. Goods travel all over the globe, supplying just-in-time retail stocks, keeping consumers satisfied and businesses profitable. But there are vulnerabilities, and Choke Points reveals them—and the ways that workers are finding ways to make use of the power that those choke points afford them. Exploring a number of case studies around the world, this book uncovers a little-known network of resistance by logistics workers worldwide who are determined to contest their exploitation by the forces of global capital. Through close accounts of wildcat strikes, roadblocks, and boycotts, from South China to Southern California, the contributors build a picture of a movement that flies under the radar, but carries the potential to force dramatic change."`

<a name="logisticalhistories">Logistical Histories</a>
====================
The supply chain has a hard origin point in history—when business consultant Keith Oliver proposed, in a meeting with the Dutch consumer electronics manufacturer Philips, the idea of managing production, marketing, distribution, sales, and finance “as though” they were a single entity. He called the approach, "supply chain management." But logistical operation has a far more ancient lineage than this. Since the beginning of time humans have exchanged goods, moved materials, and distributed the work of production. Historical accounts that are relevant to the study of logistics include its recognition in the art of war and its adoption by businesses for the optimization of transportation and manufacture, but they also include broader histories of commodity exchange, labor, and nature.

	`"Cotton is so ubiquitous as to be almost invisible, yet understanding its history is key to understanding the origins of modern capitalism. Sven Beckert tells the story of how, in a remarkably brief period, European entrepreneurs and powerful statesmen recast the world’s most significant manufacturing industry, combining imperial expansion and slave labor with new machines and wage workers to change the world. The empire of cotton was, from the beginning, a fulcrum of constant global struggle between slaves and planters, merchants and statesmen, workers and factory owners. Beckert makes clear how these forces ushered in the world of modern capitalism, and how the present global world came to exist."`

	`"Studying a single food or commodity such as sugar may seem like an incongruous project for an anthropologist who claims to work mostly with living people. Still, it is a rich subject for someone interested in the history and character of the modern world, for its importance and popularity rose together with tea, colonial slavery, and the machine era. Had it not been for the immense importance of sugar in the world history of food, and in the daily lives of so many, I would have left it alone ... My work on sugar, _Sweetness and Power_, situates it within Western history because it was an old commodity, basic to the emergence of a global market."`

========================
In a 1928 letter to Henry Ford, José Eustasio Rivera suggested that, were rubber to speak, "...it would exhale the most accusing wail, formed by the cries of flesh torn away by the whip, the moans of bodies devastated by hunger and swollen by beriberi, and the screams of the exploited and persecuted tribes." Things cannot speak, but this has not stopped them from being ventriloquized for all sorts of purposes. In early capitalism so-called "it-narratives" functioned as a way to understand the changes that had taken place in the production of things, and legacy of this genre has persisted as they have become ever-more complex, spread out throughout the supply chain.

>*	`Matsutake is the most valuable mushroom in the world—and a weed that grows in human-disturbed forests across the northern hemisphere. Through its ability to nurture trees, matsutake helps forests to grow in daunting places. It is also an edible delicacy in Japan, where it sometimes commands astronomical prices. In all its contradictions, matsutake offers insights into areas far beyond just mushrooms and addresses a crucial question: what manages to live in the ruins we have made? A tale of diversity within our damaged landscapes, The Mushroom at the End of the World follows one of the strangest commodity chains of our times to explore the unexpected corners of capitalism. Here, we witness the varied and peculiar worlds of matsutake commerce: the worlds of Japanese gourmets, capitalist traders, Hmong jungle fighters, industrial forests, Yi Chinese goat herders, Finnish nature guides, and more. These companions also lead us into fungal ecologies and forest histories to better understand the promise of cohabitation in a time of massive human destruction.`

<a name="migrationmobilityandmovement">Migration, Mobility, and Movement</a>
=================================
Global logistics depends on movement, on scale and on speed. It operationalizes and operates on the minute movements of fingers and hands, just as it does gross navigation across vast distance. It is this latter association that this section considers, examining the relationship of logistics and migratory labor. Throughout much of the Global North, migrant laborers are responsible for many of the logistical operations of urban life: driving, delivering, picking, and packing. They work in warehouses and factories, kitchens and homes. And indeed, this recurring tension between urban and rural drives productive potential throughout the world. Even in industries as fundamental as consumer electronics, global consumption depends on products produced (cheaply) as a result of the largest migrations in human history.

<a name="corporationsandcapitalism">Corporations and Capitalism</a>
===========================
While critiques of the corporation reach back to the birth of capitalism, one of the first critiques of the supply chain came when protesters targeted Dow Chemical's manufacture of napalm. The conclusion—that corporations should be responsible for what they produce—served to negotiate the relationship between publics and products. As corporations became increasingly complex, however, this connection was no longer so clear. When evidence was found in 1996 of child labor in textile outsourcing, the public outcry that resulted from Nike's infamous "sweatshop summer" signaled a renegotiation of corporate responsibility. Companies were now to be held accountable for the whole of their supply chain.

*   Pietra Rivoli and Sandra Waddock, “‘First They Ignore You…’: The Time-Context Dynamic and Corporate Responsibility,” _California Management Review_ 53, no. 2 (Winter 2011): 87-104.
	`"Pietra Rivoli and Sandra Waddock acknowledge that corporate social responsibility (CSR) discussions often fall prey to a logical trap. If some socially desirable activity is profitable, then it is best described as “intelligent operation of the business.” When private profits and public welfare are aligned, CSR is irrelevant. If the socially desirable activity is not profitable, then companies will not voluntarily undertake it unless required to do so by law or regulation. The concept of CSR is “intensely confused” because in both the above cases it is not a useful construct; CSR is either irrelevant or ineffective."`

Software, Ben Bratton writes, is a "part of every supply chain." And indeed, it is impossible to speak of global logistics without considering the logistical software systems that govern it. Companies like SAP design integrated solutions that not only manage the whole of the supply chain, they constitute it. If production and digitization have become nearly synonymous, what differrence is the container from the cloud?

With the growing prevalence of offshore manufacturing and suppliers' reliance on "just-in-time" inventory management, SCM has become both astoundingly complex and critical to companies' competitiveness. This essay examines how data works in global supply chains, focusing on SAP SCM, the huge but hard-to-access SCM software with the greatest market share. It argues that SCM is characterized by two countervailing tendencies: the demand for perfect information about goods and movement, and the need to erect strategic barriers to the fullest knowledge about supply chains. Counterintuitively, this selective obscurantism is what makes supply chains so fast and efficient."`

<a name="infrastructuresandspaces">Infrastructures and Spaces</a>
==========================
Geography, Clare Lyster writes, "is no longer a prerequisite for urbanism; the network is. At the same time that logistics denies place, however, it would be misleading to say that it is completely a-geographic." Rather, it only "upends the city's traditional reliance on geophysical qualities to facilitate new possibilities..."

*  Clare Lyster, _Learning from Logistics: How Networks Change Our Cities_ (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2016).
	`"In the 19th century railroads and canals provided both structure and motor for city development. This role has been taken over today by the global flow of data and products, as the author argues. Flow of material and communication is the DNA of contemporary environments. This development has enormous and partially unfathomable implications for our city fabric. Logistics networks and their complex structure increasingly bear upon many urban spheres. Counter trends to the ubiquitous internet retail trade – to name one of the most palpable phenomena – are gaining momentum as well, exemplified by the criticism of labor conditions in e-commerce and the trend to buy regional products from local stores. Lyster describes the current development and its impact on architecture, landscape architecture and urbanism: Aspects such as today’s hypermobility of both products and people have repercussions in design work and create new paradigms for architecture and urban design. Concepts for the integration of these new issues are introduced by a number of exemplary urban design projects."`

"In the new predominance of an organized market," Raymond Williams wrote, "the acts of making and of using goods and services were newly defined in the increasingly abstract pairings of producer and consumer, production and consumption." The term, once meant in "an unfavourable sense"—"to destroy, to use up, to waste, to exhaust," has become _the_ identity through which the supply chain is approached—an abstract relationship from which to view an abstraction.

	`"The Forgotten Space follows container cargo aboard ships, barges, trains and trucks, listening to workers, engineers, planners, politicians, and those marginalized by the global transport system. We visit displaced farmers and villagers in Holland and Belgium, underpaid truck drivers in Los Angeles, seafarers aboard mega-ships shuttling between Asia and Europe, and factory workers in China, whose low wages are the fragile key to the whole puzzle. And in Bilbao, we discover the most sophisticated expression of the belief that the maritime economy, and the sea itself, is somehow obsolete."`

Considering what it actually means to “be wired” and in turn, to be connected, in today’s global economic system, the video follows the detailed production process that transforms raw ore into copper wire—in this case, the literal digging of a hole to China—and the generation of waste and of power that grows in both countries as byproduct."`

	`"The film Gravesend uses a documentary approach to focus on the mining of coltan, employed in the manufacture of cell phones, laptops and other high-tech apparatus. The film cuts between two sites: a technological, highly automated industrial plant in the West where the precious metal is processed for the final production of microelectronic parts, and the central Congo, where miners use simple shovels or their bare hands to extract, wash and collect the ore on leaves. In the Congo, the dirt and clumps of ore are barely distinguishable, while in the industrialized West, the metal is weighed in minute milligrams and cast in antiseptic surroundings."`

	`"Shipbreakers takes the viewer into the heart of Alang, India, a vibrant shantytown where 40,000 people live and work in the most primitive conditions. Since the early '80s, the rusting hulks of thousands of the world's largest ships have been driven onto the remote beaches of Alang, off the Arabian Sea, to be dismantled, piece by piece. Sold for scrap, the ship owners rarely bother to abide by the UN Basel Convention, which bans shipments of transboundary waste.

<a name="logisticsincinema">Logistics in Cinema</a>
----
For Marshall McLuhan, cinema was an assembly line comprised "of still shots on celluloid,” where mechanical movement and the projection of light came together to create the “illusion” of motion. Paul Virilio suggested that it was this quality that allowed cinema to “get away from the static focus and share the speed of moving objects." Cinema operated in logistical space, with "fragments" assembled in "non-sensory order.” Not in products, but in montage. Cinematic images are powerful, he explains, because, now, “to move was to produce." Despite this suggestive overlap, logistical operations have themselves rarely been cinematic subjects—though in television Mary Tyler Moore spinoff Lou Grant famously opened with the lifecycle of newspaper production, from the falling of timber to an ignominious end as birdcage liner. More often, the logistical labor of the supply chain is largely a backdrop for other human dramas.

"What one sees in a harbor is the concrete movement of goods. This movement can be explained in its totality only through recourse to abstraction. Marx tells us this, even if no one is listening anymore. If the stock market is the site in which the abstract character of money rules, the harbor is the site in which material goods appear in bulk, in the very flux of exchange. Use values slide by in the channel; the Ark is no longer a bestiary but an encyclopedia of trade and industry. This is the reason for the antique mercantilist charm of harbors. But the more regularized, literally container-ized, the movement of goods in harbors, that is, the more rationalized and automated, the more the harbor comes to resemble the stock market. A crucial phenomenological point here is the suppression of smell. Goods that once reeked—guano, gypsum, steamed tuna, hemp, molasses—now flow or are boxed. The boxes, viewed in vertical elevation, have the proportions of slightly elongated banknotes. The contents anonymous: electronic components, the worldly belongings of military dependents, cocaine, scrap paper (who could know?) hidden behind the corrugated sheet steel walls emblazoned with the logos of the global shipping corporations: Evergreen, Matson, American President, Mitsui, Hanjin, Hyundai." — Allan Sekula, _Fish Story_.

To suggest, as Sam Halliday does, Bram Stoker's epistolary novel as one of the "logistical sublime," is to recognize its peculiarly modern fascination with time. “Left Munich at 8.35 p.m. on 1st May," the first line reads, "arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6.46, but train was an hour late.” As a result of the encounter, Halliday notes, Harker’s interest in “the correct time” will become a near-obsession. Indeed, _Dracula_ is a sequence of events, near misses, and long delays punctuated by sudden collisions. Like the examples below, it is a story of the mediation of movement in space and time, of storage and transmission in sites both recognizably logistical and not.
